# Progress log (for video and write-ups)

One entry per step that changed what a person can do or see. Each has the plain-words line, what to show
on screen, and where the proof is. Add to the top. Say only what the live site does today.

## Where we stand against other compliance tools

| Gap named in the comparison | Status |
|---|---|
| Duplicate entries from double clicks | **Fixed** (PR 50) |
| Actions still shown on a locked control | **Fixed** (PR 50) |
| Switching role silently returned the old user | **Fixed** (PR 49) |
| Firm admin could not open a client | **Fixed** (PR 51) |
| Users page: see team, change roles, switch someone off | **Done** (PR 52, ADR-036) |
| Controls page fed by every source, not only GitHub | Open |
| In-app connector setup | Open (needs a design for stored secrets first) |
| Fuller framework catalogue, policy templates | Open |
| Vendor risk, trust centre, questionnaire answers | Open |
| AI help on the live site | Open (the model runs on a personal machine; needs a stable address) |

Where we lead: the verdict comes from fixed rules, never from a model; a named human signs and locks; every
step is in a tamper-evident log; the DPDP Act pack for India.

## Entries

### 3 Nov 2026: Switch someone off without losing their history (PR 52)
- **Say:** "An admin can now see everyone who has access, change a role, or switch a person off. They lose
  access straight away, and everything they did stays on record under their name."
- **Show:** Admin page, Team card. Change a role from the drop-down. Press Deactivate on a spare account;
  that person is signed out on their next click. Press Reactivate.
- **Also true:** the last admin can't be removed, nobody can switch themselves off, and every change is in
  the activity log with the before and after.
- **Proof:** 9 new tests; live database checked after release, all 5 users still active.

### 3 Nov 2026: A firm can open a client (PR 51)
- **Say:** "A firm admin opens any client they audit from one console, with the live numbers beside it."
- **Show:** Firm console: client card with controls, locked, open gaps, staffed auditor. Press Open this
  client. The Controls page loads with the client's locked control.
- **Found by:** testing the live site as the firm admin. The button did nothing for people who sign in
  through the company login.

### 3 Nov 2026: Cleaner sign-off and a clearer lock (PR 50)
- **Say:** "Submitting for review records once, however many times you click. A closed control shows no
  actions that can't apply."
- **Show:** the control page as the client (banner: closed by the auditor, read-only); the auditor's
  "Record verdict and lock" button.
- **Found by:** the audit history showed four "submitted" entries from one click.

### 3 Nov 2026: Signing out really signs you out (PR 49)
- **Say:** "Switch between client, auditor and firm on the same computer, with a password check each time."
- **Show:** Sign out, pick Auditor, type the password, land on the auditor's review queue.

### 3 Nov 2026: Evidence from four systems, stored safely
- **Say:** "One press collects evidence from AWS, Microsoft 365, the HR system and GitHub. Each source says
  whether it finished or only partly worked, and a partial run is never treated as a pass."
- **Show:** DPDP readiness: four cards turn READY and COMPLETE, the score moves from 0% to 22%, AWS shows
  PARTIAL. Gaps page: exact value found next to the value needed.
- **Fixed on the way:** stored evidence now goes to a private bucket on the new database project.

### 3 Nov 2026: The auditor's sign-off, end to end
- **Say:** "The client submits. The auditor reviews, records a decision with a reason, and the control
  locks. The rules said partial; the auditor's different decision needs a written reason, and both stay on
  record."
- **Show:** control page as client, then as auditor (reason box required before the button works), then the
  History tab with the auditor's reason, then the client's read-only view.
- **Proof:** history shows VERDICT_REGISTERED with the reason, the person and the time.

## Scenes still to film
- Team card with Deactivate/Reactivate (needs an org admin session).
- AI help (Explain, Ask AI) once the model has a stable address.
- The Controls page with more than three controls, once every source feeds it.
